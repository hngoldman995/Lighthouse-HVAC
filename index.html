						<h2>Our Heating Services</h2>
						<p>Your home's air conditioner is an essential part of your overall indoor comfort. A
							properly working system can mean the difference between a cool, comfortable summer and a
							hot, miserable few months. If you're currently dealing with a broken air conditioner, an
							inefficient system, or you would like to schedule a routine, pre-season tune-up, Lighthouse HVAC is here to help!</p>
						<h2>Our Air Conditioning Services</h2>
						<p>LightHouse HVAC offers an unmatched level of service. Whether you need a furnace repair,
							heat pump replacement, new system installation, or comprehensive maintenance for your
							home's heating system, you can reply on our skilled team to get the job done quickly and
							efficiently.
							Maintenance for heating and air conditioning units in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems is important for several reasons:

							Energy Efficiency: Regular maintenance helps ensure that your HVAC system operates at peak efficiency. A well-maintained system will consume less energy to provide the same level of heating or cooling, resulting in lower utility bills.
							
							System Lifespan: HVAC systems are significant investments, and regular maintenance can extend their lifespan. By addressing minor issues and preventing major breakdowns, you can avoid premature system failure and the need for costly replacements.
							
							Performance and Comfort: Properly maintained HVAC units deliver consistent and reliable heating or cooling throughout your home or building. By keeping the system in good condition, you can maintain a comfortable indoor environment, ensuring the temperature and humidity levels are optimal.

							<h1>Indoor Air Quality</h1>
						</header>
						<h2>Why it's important</h2>
						<p>
							When air inside your home becomes more polluted than the air outside, what can you do? Your HVAC system affects more than just the temperature of your home. We can also use your HVAC system to address issues with indoor air quality (IAQ). At LightHouse HVAC, we offer a variety of tools and guidance to improve the air quality of your home.
							<br>
							There are many ways to improve your indoor air quality using your HVAC system such as: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Increase air circulation</li>
								<li>Schedule regular maintenance for your HVAC system</li>
								<li>Check your HVAC filters regularly</li>
								<li>Invest in indoor air quality (IAQ) products</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							By increasing your air circulation, you can address several air quality issues including presence of dust, polluted air, humidity, or uneven temperatures. 
							<br>
							Increased air circulation means that your HVAC filtration system filters the air in your home frequently and successfully, which can help those who suffer from asthma and allergies.
							<br>Checking your HVAC filters is imperative to maintaining proper indoor air quality (IAQ). Your HVAC filter's job is to remove dust, allergens, and debris from the air in your home. 
							<br>
							As your filter collects these particles, it's normal for your filter to get dirty. The longer a filter stays in your system, the dirtier it will become. If you go too long between changing your filter, it can become clogged, and clogged filters can seriously damage your system.That is why it's important to change your filter regularly. 
							<br>
							Scheduling regular maintenance for your HVAC system can also improve your indoor air quality (IAQ). When an HVAC technician services your system, they don't just check for issues with your system, any HVAC maintenance appointment also includes a cleaning.
							<br>
							Sometimes your existing HVAC system can use a little help to address poor air quality issues, if your health and comfort are at risk, then your HVAC partner can add IAQ products to your system. <br>Invest in HVAC indoor air quality products such as humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air purifiers if necessary.
